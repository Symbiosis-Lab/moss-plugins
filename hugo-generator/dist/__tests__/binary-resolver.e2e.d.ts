/**
 * E2E tests for Binary Resolution and Auto-Download
 *
 * These tests verify the binary resolver functionality:
 * - Detection of Hugo from system PATH
 * - Detection from configured path
 * - Auto-download when Hugo is not available
 * - Version extraction
 * - Error handling
 *
 * Note: Some tests require network access to GitHub.
 * Tests that would download Hugo are only run in CI with TEST_DOWNLOAD_HUGO=true.
 *
 * Run with: npm run test:e2e
